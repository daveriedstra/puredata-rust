# Pure Data Rust Sys

The `pd-sys` create provides Rust FFI bindings for [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/) aka *pd*, a graphical multi-media programming language.
The bindings are exclusively based on [m_pd.h](https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data/blob/master/src/m_pd.h) and most likely to be used
for building plugins aka *externals*.
