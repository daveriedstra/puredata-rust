# HelloWorld

A minimal example based on the HOWTO [my first external: helloworld](https://github.com/pure-data/externals-howto#my-first-external-helloworld) example.

Can be built with `cargo build` or, for more features.. use `cargo-make` and read the details
of that in the [README.md](../../../utils/README.md) for that.
